h2. FFI Javascript minifier

h3. Description

This library was created in order to provide a reasonably fast Javascript
minifier on JRuby platform.
Both native Java and Ruby implementations were found to be in several orders
of magnitude slower.
The only change from the original C implementation, is that it was changed
to C++ (in order to make global variables become instance variables),
and it works with buffers rather than stdin/stdout now.

h3. Synopsis

 input = IO.read('prototype.js')
 begin
   output = Jsmin.process!(input)
   File.open('output.js', 'w') {|f| f.write(output)}
 rescue Jsmin::ParseException => e
   $stderr.puts "Cannot minify: #{e}"
 end

h3. Bugs

The memory allocated in the C++ code might not be freed.
It depends on how FFI handles the returned char*.
